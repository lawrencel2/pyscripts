Hello everyone! Welcome to my Github. My name is Lawrence Lechuga and I am a PhD candidate at UW Madison. In this repository you will find various Binder links that attempt to walk students through exercises and discussions of the mathematics of medical imaging and their applications. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or requests!
